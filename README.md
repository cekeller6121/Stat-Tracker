This is a personal statistics app project assigned by The Iron Yard. In it's complete functionality (I use that term deliberately) it should be able to allow a user to track multiple different stats, and log them into a database. I'm still in the very early stages of developing this, and I may add that this is the most difficult project I've had to do so far.
